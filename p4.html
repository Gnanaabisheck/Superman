            Zack Snyder's Justice League (colloquially referred to as the Snyder Cut) is the 2021 director's cut of the 2017 American superhero film Justice League, the fifth film set within the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) based on the team of the same name appearing in DC Comics publications. It is intended to match director Zack Snyder's original vision for the film, prior to his departure from the production and subsequent studio interference. The film follows Batman (Ben Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Cyborg (Ray Fisher), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), The Flash (Ezra Miller), and a revived Superman (Henry Cavill) as they form an alliance to stop the extradimensional New God Steppenwolf (Ciar√°n Hinds) and his army of Parademons from conquering Earth for his overlord Darkseid (Ray Porter).

            <p class="p-4 lh-lg">
                Thousands of years ago, Apokoliptian warlord Darkseid and his Parademons attempted to take over the Earth using the combined energies of three Mother Boxes. Darkseid was foiled by a unified alliance of the Olympian Gods, Amazons, Atlanteans, humanity, and extraterrestrial beings.[c] The Mother Boxes were then separated and hidden in different locations. In the present, the death of Superman at the hands of Doomsday[d] triggers the Boxes' reactivation, attracting Steppenwolf, Darkseid's disgraced lieutenant. Steppenwolf aims to regain Darkseid's favor by gathering the boxes to form "The Unity", which would terraform Earth into a copy of their homeworld.Steppenwolf reaches Themyscira through a portal and fights the Amazons to obtain their Mother Box. Diana Prince informs Bruce Wayne, as the two are seeking to form a team of metahumans[d] to protect the planet. After failing to recruit Arthur Curry, Bruce locates Barry Allen, who enthusiastically joins. Diana locates the cyborg Victor Stone, who joins after his father, Silas, and other S.T.A.R. Labs employees are kidnapped by Parademons seeking the Mother Box hidden by the humans. Steppenwolf kills Atlantean guards and takes their Mother Box, forcing Arthur to join the group as well.
