Created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, both characters including Superman's alter ego, Clark Kent, first appeared in DC Comics' Action Comics #1 (June 1938). They have remained in a complicated relationship ever since. A supercouple, they are among the best known fictional couples and have appeared in multiple media adaptations. 
                        Lois is the character most prominently featured with Superman, she appears in virtually every Superman comics and media adaptations and continues to be an essential part of the Superman mythos. Across decades of comics and other media adaptations, in some stories, Lois knows or suspects that Clark is Superman, sometimes this is explored for humour or plot development.

                            At the same time, Superman's strength does have a limit - while Superman has been depicted as performing feats of infinite strength in the past, these were either out-of-canon versions of the hero or took place on different planes of reality.

                            The user possesses tactile telekinesis, the power to move, manipulate or otherwise interact with matter and energy through mental effort or other means through physical contact. The differences between telekinesis and tactile telekinesis are their distance of influence. Normal telekinetics can move matter and objects from a distance without direct contact with the body; meantime, tactile telekinetics are restricted to manipulating what they're touching.

                            X-Ray Vision is a term that describes the ability to see through solid objects. Kryptonians, Daxamites and Martians are among those who possess this sense.The method by which this is possible is unclear. In most cases, the ability can more accurately be described as "see-through vision" since what the viewer sees contains more information than what an X-ray scan can provide.Kryptonians and Daxamites can see through any object with the exception of lead, while Martians can see through any object.

                            Heat Vision is a superpower possessed by Kryptonians and Daxamites when exposed to the yellow sun; see Photonucleic Effect. It is the ability to release massive amounts of solar energy stored within the body through the eyes, in focused beams of heat (Presumably, as infra-red light).It was originally considered to be a subset of X-Ray Vision; for example, Superman was known to melt metal with "The heat of his X-Ray vision". As his powers developed and became more defined, however, Heat Vision became distinguished as an individual power.
